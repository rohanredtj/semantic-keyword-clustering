# Semantic Keyword Clustering Tool for Adwords

## Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated Python-based suite of tools for comprehensive keyword analysis and categorization, specifically designed for Adwords campaigns. The suite includes a Semantic Keyword Clustering Tool, a KW Statistical Package, and a Python Categorization Tool. These tools leverage natural language processing techniques to process, clean, analyze, and categorize large volumes of keywords, enhancing SEO and content strategy efforts.

## Key Components

### 1. Semantic Keyword Clustering Tool
- Large-scale keyword processing and semantic analysis
- Advanced text cleaning and preprocessing
- Semantic similarity calculation using sentence transformers
- Community detection algorithms for cluster creation

### 2. KW Statistical Package
- Keyword cleaning and scoring
- N-gram analysis (unigram, bigram, trigram, fourgram)
- Customizable stopword and keepword lists
- Output of comprehensive keyword analysis files

### 3. Python Categorization Tool
- Business filter application
- Categorization of cleaned keywords into predefined patterns
- Integration with cleaned keyword outputs from KW Statistical Package

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  - Sentence Transformers: For generating keyword embeddings
  - NLTK: For natural language processing tasks
  - Scikit-learn: For machine learning utilities
  - Custom modules for specific analysis tasks

## Workflow
1. **Data Import and Initial Cleaning** (KW Statistical Package):
   - Loading of raw keyword data
   - Application of custom stopword and keepword lists
   - N-gram analysis
2. **Semantic Analysis and Clustering** (Semantic Keyword Clustering Tool):
   - Generation of keyword embeddings
   - Implementation of community detection for clustering
3. **Categorization** (Python Categorization Tool):
   - Application of business filters
   - Categorization based on predefined patterns

## Key Features
- Modular design allowing for standalone or integrated use of tools
- Customizable parameters for cleaning, analysis, and categorization
- Support for large-scale keyword processing (50,000+ keywords)
- Integration of linguistic knowledge through custom word lists
- Detailed output files for comprehensive keyword insights

## Technical Challenges Addressed
- **Data Volume**: Efficient processing of large keyword sets
- **Linguistic Complexity**: Handling of multi-word expressions and domain-specific terminology
- **Customizability**: Flexible parameter settings and word lists for different use cases
- **Integration**: Seamless workflow from raw data to categorized, clustered keywords

## System Requirements
- Python environment with required libraries
- Detailed setup instructions provided in separate documentation

## Usage
Detailed command-line instructions for each tool, including:
- File paths for input data, configuration files, and output directories
- Column name specifications
- Examples of command execution

## Conclusion
The suite significantly enhances Adwords campaign management and SEO strategy by providing deep insights into keyword relationships, themes, and categories. It showcases the power of combining NLP techniques with marketing domain knowledge to create practical, high-impact solutions for digital marketing professionals.
